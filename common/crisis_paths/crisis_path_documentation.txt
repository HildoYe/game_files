# CRISIS PATHS
# When a player selects the Become the Crisis perk they also get to select a crisis path that determines the crisis levels that they'll have to achieve.
# Levels are achieved and unlocked in the order they are scripted.
# Note: it's recommended to have 5 levels for each path, or the UI will look misaligned.
#

#	crisis_currency = ""        # Name of the resource that will be gained by the objectives and used as requirement to unlock levels.
#                               # The resource will need to be defined in common/strategic_resources.
#                               # This resource name will also be used to select the loc strings to be used in the crisis view.
#                               # In cybernetics_l_english there is a block of loc keys that lies under 'CRISIS UI' that can be used as reference
