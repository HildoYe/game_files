# Hopefully someday we will write a full file here.

# For now, note about "cost":
# You can (in both species and leader traits) specify something like
	# cost = {
	# 	base = 1
	# 	modifier = {
	# 		add = 2
	# 		has_country_flag = something #(no way of accessing species scope, it proved highly impractical)
	# 	}
	# }
# If you do this, the "base" will be used in cases where there is no country scope (e.g. customising a species in empire setup, and various
# randomisation functions used mainly during galaxy generation. And a few more places). So you should always set that to a sensible number.

# Some parameters for species traits
#
# category = <category type>: Sets the category the trait is a part of. Current categories { normal(default), cyborg, robotic, psionic, advanced_genetic, overtuned }
#
# assembly_score: evaluated when the game decides to build a species. Default is 0, anything positive adds some extra weight to
# a species with that trait. (Has species and planet scope). A value of 0 does not stop it being picked, it just means this factor won't make
# a difference. If you make it strongly negative, it will not pick this species. You probably only want to be in the range from -2 to 2 or so.
#
# allowed_archetypes = {}
# Determines if the trait is valid for the given archetypes.
# Accepts BIOLOGICAL, LITHOID, ROBOT, and MACHINE by default.
#
# species_class = {}
# Determines if the trait is valid for the given species class.
# Requires the species class is a member of an allowed archetype.
#
# opposites = {}
# Opposite traits are mutually exclusive.
# IMPORTANT: if you add a new positive trait, please add it to the opposites = {} block of trait_invasive!
#
# species_potential_add = {}
# Show the trait to add to species when genemodding or randomizing traits.
# Scopes are this = species, from = country performing the modification.

# default = always=yes

# species_possible_merge_add = {}
# Governs if the trait can be added when applying a template to an existing species with genemodding.

# species_possible_remove = {}
# Allow to remove the trait when genemodding.

# Required for triggered modifiers that use pop_growth_speed, pop_environment_tolerance or such.

# triggered_species_modifier = {}
# Applied to pops if the trigger is true.

# triggered_pop_modifier = {}
# Applied to pops if the trigger is true.
# Won't show in trait tooltips, use custom_tooltip/custom_tooltip_with_modifiers.
