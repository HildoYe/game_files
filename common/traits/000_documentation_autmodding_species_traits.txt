# Pops with any of the following traits will attempt to swap it's applied modifier with a trait with matching trait category within it's current job's defined auto_trait_prio list.
# Planets goes through an amount of pops every month to see if the pop has a new trait which fits better and instantly switches at that point.
# The amount is decided by the define BASE_AUTO_MOD and any additions through the MOD_AUTO_MOD_MONTHLY_ADD and MOD_AUTO_MOD_MONTHLY_MULT
#
# Auto Mod traits require the following to function
# auto_mod = yes
# category = normal/cyborg/robotic/psionic/advanced_genetic/overtuned
#
# Having multiple auto_mod traits for the same category will not stack
# The auto_trait_prio list on jobs should contain one valid trait swap for each trait category.
# The modifier on the trait itself can be used as a default for the case where a job does not have an auto_trait_prio list.
