# Basic is inherited by all. It has:
#	- high base weights for vital things, like amenities, housing and countering crime
#	- low base weights for other buildings, which the other plans will fall back on if they can't do what they are
#		meant to for whatever reason (also so it knows how to update buildings you plant there)
# Other plans overwrite weights for their special field so that the sector will favour these
# Whether the planet can get pops to work the jobs from the building, and whether the owner can afford the upkeep,
# are now checked in code (this doesn't cover upkeep from jobs)
# Add exempt_from_jobs_check = yes to not run the jobs check on this building (e.g. for capital buildings, where you
# pretty much always want to upgrade them)

# The code will pick a priority building first. If it doesn't find one, it'll try districts, then buildings, then upgrades.
